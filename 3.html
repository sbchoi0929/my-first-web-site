<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is
     one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 
     2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often i
     ncorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript 
     engine to execute the code on users' devices.

    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to 
    the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orienta
    tion, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, fu
    nctional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interf
    aces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data struct
    ures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking
    , storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime sy
    stem provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
    
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core comp
    onents of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime syste
    m for this usage is Node.js.
    
    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard li
    braries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly 
    in design.</p></body></html>
